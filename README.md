arduino_work
============

Random Arduino sketches that I'm making available. Please feel free to use and 
borrow as needed within the guidelines of the MIT license.

## Notes

1. Use this code at your own risk!! The sketches should all work but I make no
   guarantees (see license below)
2. Theis repo just contains a collection of Arduino sketches. Each directory 
   contains a project which should compile with ino. 
3. You may need to modify the ino.ini files to match your hardware. 

## License

All work is released under the MIT License unless otherwise noted within an
individual project director or file. See `LICENSE.txt`.
