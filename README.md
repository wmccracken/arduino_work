============

Random Arduino sketches that I'm making available. Please feel free to use and 
borrow as needed within the guidelines of the MIT license.

Feel free to contact me with any questions - <will@wgmamm.com>

## Notes

1. Use this code at your own risk!! The sketches should all work but I make no
   guarantees (see license below).
2. Each directory contains a project which should compile with ino 
   <http://inotool.org>.
3. You may need to modify the ino.ini files to match your hardware.
